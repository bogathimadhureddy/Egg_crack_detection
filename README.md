# Egg Crack Detection

## Introduction:
* People are giving priority to high-quality food products. Eggs are excellent sources of protein and nutrients.
* Eggshells are prone to develop cracks during their handling process.
* Egg industries emphasize on eliminating cracked eggs from reaching the consumers, as cracks contaminate the egg contents.
* Automation of crack detection has resulted in the development of acoustic response and computer vision systems.

## Business Problem:
* Manually counting each cracked egg becomes impractical due to the sheer volume, leading to significant time and effort investment. 
* The need for efficiency in food preparation is hindered by the time-consuming nature of manual egg cracking Detection, crucial in meeting customer demands and maintaining a smooth workflow. 
* Human error is a constant risk when manually counting items at scale, potentially resulting in inaccurate inventory records and wastage
