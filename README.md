# Egg_crack_detection

## Introduction:
People are giving priority to high-quality food products. Eggs are excellent sources of protein and nutrients.
Eggshells are prone to develop cracks during their handling process.
Egg industries emphasize on eliminating cracked eggs from reaching the consumers, as cracks contaminate the egg contents.
Automation of crack detection has resulted in the development of acoustic response and computer vision systems.


Creating and implementing a Neural network model to design an egg classification system that  allows a machine to directly classify the egg type and crack.
